## Drawing Requirement  
üç∞ Can be found by clicking the button with the cake emoji under the "Let Them Eat Cake" header.  
üñºÔ∏è The image for reference can be seen by clicking the painting emoji, I changed the colors because I liked the one on the canvas better.

## Creative Elements  
To display my creativity, I added:  
- `asg1.css` to change the page's appearance (mainly focused here)  
  - Included an easel to make it feel more like a painting  
  - Added images to preview the shape options
  - Added images to preview the canvas color options
  - Changed slider colors to add more contrast
  - Color previewer to see the newly selected color
- Allowed for opacity in `asg1.js`   

## Note to Graders (also in `asg1.html`)  
- In `asg1.js`, I used ChatGPT to help me figure out the math when looping over points (for the drawing, it's the cake frosting).  
  - I cited where it was used.  
- In `asg1.css`, I used w3schools to allow the sliders to have a nicer format.  
- There was also an instance at a certain circle segment count where the opacity reveals an additional triangle in the opacity (it does the same triangle twice in one spot), but I was unable to recreate it.
- I've also taken a class where we wrote in JavaScript, but I forgot the convention for placing classes in folders, so the `shape-classes` folder indicates where the `triangle`, `circle`, and `point` classes are for now.  
- I also was only able to test the site on my laptop, so I'm unsure if all instances of the site will format correctly like on my end. 
  - Please let me know if there is an organizational preference for the class or if the page is in an odd format on your end. Thank you :)
